# Assembly Line Optimization Algorithm

This project contains a Python implementation of an algorithm designed to optimize the workflow of an assembly line by distributing steps across multiple stations efficiently, thereby minimizing the maximum duration that any single station takes.

## Overview

The algorithm takes in a list of durations, each representing the time taken for each step in the assembly line, and a number of stations. It then computes the optimal way to distribute these steps across the given stations such that the longest time any station takes is minimized. This problem is solved using a binary search algorithm which aims to find the best maximum station duration.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Setup

No additional setup is required, as the script uses the Python standard library only.

## Usage

To use the optimization algorithm, you must have Python installed on your system. You can run but using the run button or the script using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 Algorithm1_Optimizing_Production_Lines.py
